The remote-webscripts project can be imported as an existing Eclipse project into the Eclipse IDE. If the Alfresco SDK has been imported into the same Eclipse workspace, the project will have everything it needs to build successfully.

Building the project with Ant

The project includes an build.xml and a build.properties. If you do not modify the project folder structure, you should only have to modify the build.properties file to specify the location of the Alfresco SDK and the Alfresco web application root folder.
