# alfresco-developer-guide
This project holds the source code that accompanies the Alfresco Developer Guide (Packt Publishing, 2008). The publisher has the official source code that is distributed with the book, but it is made available as a single zip. The goal of this project is to make it easier for readers to get book source code specific to a chapter and release of Alfresco.

The code has been tested (and tagged) against the following Alfresco releases:

* Alfresco 2.2.4 Enterprise
* Alfresco 3d Labs
* Alfresco 3.0.1 Enterprise
* Alfresco 3.1.1 Enterprise
* Alfresco 3.2 Community
* Alfresco 3.2 Enterprise
* Alfresco 3.3 Community
* Alfresco 3.3 Enterprise
* Alfresco 3.4c Community
* Alfresco 3.4 Enterprise 

Starting with 3.2 Enterprise, we stopped supporting the CAS example in Chapter 9. The rest of the examples should work in for all releases mentioned above.

Don't use the code that's in trunk. Instead, use the code in the tag for the specific book chapter and Alfresco release that you are interested in.
